Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript
    
    windows:
    * the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

    Document:
    * The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
      
    screen:  
    * The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript, which is potentially confusing because we call an application's portion of the screen a window when talking about interactions with the operating system. The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with top, left, bottom, and right properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.
